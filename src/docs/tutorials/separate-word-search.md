title: Separate Word Search

_Constraint: Only available in the `mark()` method_

Regardless of whether you are highlighting an array of search terms or just a
single one, it makes sense to search for each word separately. Assuming you have
a search term "lorem ipsum dolor", then this option will make {{defaults.title}}
search for "lorem", "ipsum" and "dolor" separately.
